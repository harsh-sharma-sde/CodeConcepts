title: Question 11 (CSS, Tailwind & MUI)
description: Learn how to make complex HTML tables accessible for screen readers and assistive technologies
order: 43
---

To an SDE 2, making a data table accessible is about **Semantic Mapping**. A screen reader (SR) doesn't "see" your CSS layout; it parses the **Accessibility Tree**. 

For a complex table (sorting, selection, expansion), your job is to ensure that the **Relationship** between data cells and headers is preserved and that **State Changes** are broadcast to the browser's A11y API.

---

### 1. Semantic Foundation (Native Tags)
**The SDE 2 View:** Whenever possible, use native `<table>` tags. The browser automatically assigns the correct **ARIA Roles** (`table`, `row`, `columnheader`, `cell`) which are pre-programmed into screen readers.

**Mechanics:**
- `<th>`: Informs the SR that this cell is a header.
- `scope="col"` / `scope="row"`: Explicitly defines the relationship direction. This is vital for complex tables where a row might have its own header.

```html
<table>
  <caption>Monthly Financial Report</caption> <!-- Context for SR -->
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th scope="col">Date</th>
      <th scope="col">Amount</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th scope="row">2023-10-01</th> <!-- Row Header -->
      <td>$400.00</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
```

---

### 2. Handling Interactivity (State Management)

#### A. Sorting
When a user clicks a header to sort, the SR needs to know.
- **`aria-sort`**: Use `ascending`, `descending`, or `none`.
- **SDE 2 Logic:** Do not put the `onClick` on the `<th>` itself if it contains text; put it on a `<button>` inside the `<th>`. This tells the SR that the header is interactive.

```html
<th scope="col" aria-sort="ascending">
  <button onClick={handleSort}>Date</button>
</th>
```

#### B. Selection (Checkboxes)
- **`aria-selected`**: Applied to the `<tr>` to indicate the row state.
- **`aria-multiselectable="true"`**: Applied to the `<table>` if multiple rows can be picked.

#### C. Expandable Rows
- **`aria-expanded`**: Applied to the toggle button.
- **`aria-controls`**: Points to the `id` of the row being expanded.

### 3. The Responsive Table Problem (The "Div" Table)
As an SDE 2, you often use `display: block` or `display: flex` on table elements for mobile responsiveness. 
**The Trap:** Most browsers **strip the table semantics** once you change the `display` property. To the SR, it becomes just a list of `divs`.

**The Solution:** You must manually restore the roles.

```html
<!-- Tailwind example with roles restored -->
<div role="table" aria-label="Users" class="flex flex-col">
  <div role="row" class="flex">
    <div role="columnheader" class="flex-1">Name</div>
    <div role="columnheader" class="flex-1">Email</div>
  </div>
</div>
```

### 4. Implementation in MUI vs. Tailwind

#### MUI (`Table` Component)
MUI components (like `Table`, `TableHead`, `TableCell`) render native HTML tags by default.
- **SDE 2 Tip:** Always use the `component` prop if you need to change the underlying tag while keeping the style.
- MUI handles much of the role management, but you must still manually provide `aria-label` to the `Table` and `scope` to the `TableCell`.

```jsx
<Table aria-label="purchases">
  <TableHead>
    <TableRow>
      <TableCell scope="col">Product</TableCell>
    </TableRow>
  </TableHead>
</Table>
```

#### Tailwind
Tailwind doesn't give you accessibility for free. You must follow the **WAI-ARIA Authoring Practices**.
- Use the `sr-only` class to provide context that is only visible to screen readers (e.g., "Sort by Date" instead of just a generic arrow icon).

---

### 5. SDE 2 Advanced: Dynamic Updates (`aria-live`)
If your table filters or paginated via AJAX, a screen reader user might not realize the data has changed.

**Mechanics:** Use an `aria-live` region (like `status`) to announce results.
- "Showing 10 of 50 results."
- "Filter applied: 5 items found."

```html
<div aria-live="polite" class="sr-only">
  {statusMessage} 
</div>
```

### 6. Summary Checklist for SDE 2s
1.  **Captions:** Always include a `<caption>` for table context.
2.  **Scope:** Use `scope="col"` and `scope="row"`.
3.  **Buttons:** Make headers/expanders `<button>` elements, not clickable `div`s.
4.  **Contrast:** Ensure text-to-background contrast is at least **4.5:1** (WCAG AA).
5.  **Keyboard Nav:** Users must be able to `Tab` through interactive headers and use `Enter` to sort.
6.  **Focus Management:** If a row is deleted, move the focus to the next logical element, don't let it "vanish."

### Summary
*   **Junior view:** Just use a `<table>` tag.
*   **SDE 2 view:** It is about maintaining the **Accessibility Tree** using **Explicit Scoping**, **ARIA State management** for dynamic interactions, and ensuring **Semantic Persistence** when applying responsive CSS layouts.
