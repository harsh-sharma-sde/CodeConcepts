title: CSS Flexbox vs Grid
description: Learn the differences between Flexbox and Grid, when to use each, and how they help in building responsive layouts

To an SDE 2, the choice between Flexbox and Grid isn't about "which one is better," but about the **Dimensionality of the Layout** and the **Source of Truth for Sizing** (Content-out vs. Layout-in).

---

### 1. The Dimensionality Rule
*   **Flexbox (1D):** Designed for distributing space along a **single axis** (either a row or a column). While it can wrap, it cannot coordinate the sizing of items across multiple rows.
*   **Grid (2D):** Designed for **rows and columns simultaneously**. It allows you to align items in two dimensions, creating a strict coordinate system.

---

### 2. The SDE 2 View: Content-out vs. Layout-in

#### Flexbox: "Content-out"
In Flexbox, the size of the items usually dictates the layout. The container looks at how much space the content needs and then decides how to grow or shrink them to fit.
*   **Mechanics:** The browser engine calculates the `flex-basis` of each item, then calculates the **"Positive Free Space"** or **"Negative Free Space"** in the container, and finally distributes that space based on `flex-grow` and `flex-shrink` factors.

```javascript
// Flexbox Logic (Conceptual)
AvailableSpace = ContainerWidth - TotalFlexBasis;
if (AvailableSpace > 0) {
  itemWidth = flexBasis + (AvailableSpace * (flexGrow / totalGrow));
}
```

#### Grid: "Layout-in"
In Grid, you define the layout (the tracks) first, and the items are forced into that structure. The container dictates the size of the items.
*   **Mechanics:** The browser creates a geometric grid of tracks. It uses **`fr` (Fractional)** units to divide available space after accounting for fixed-size tracks and gaps.

### 3. Code Examples

#### Flexbox: The Navigation Bar (1D)
Perfect for when you want items to sit in a line and share space, but they don't need to align with items in a different row.

```css
.navbar {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: space-between; /* Distribute space on main axis */
  align-items: center;          /* Align on cross axis */
}

.nav-item {
  flex: 1; /* Grow and shrink equally */
}
```

#### Grid: The Dashboard (2D)
Perfect for complex layouts where components must align both horizontally and vertically.

```css
.dashboard {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: 250px 1fr 1fr; /* Fixed sidebar, two flexible columns */
  grid-template-rows: auto 1fr auto;    /* Header, Content, Footer */
  gap: 20px;
  grid-template-areas: 
    "header header header"
    "sidebar main stats"
    "footer footer footer";
}

.sidebar { grid-area: sidebar; }
```

### 4. SDE 2 Deep Dive: Performance & Rendering

#### Layout Thrashing
As an SDE 2, you know that **Flexbox is computationally "cheaper"** for the browser's layout engine than Grid. 
- **Flexbox** is a linear algorithm. The browser calculates the size of items in one pass.
- **Grid** requires a more complex two-dimensional constraint solver. In very deep trees or extremely large grids (e.g., 1000+ cells), Grid can lead to longer **Reflow (Layout)** times.

#### The "Holy Grail" of Alignment
Grid allows for **overlapping elements** without using `position: absolute`. By placing two items in the same `grid-area`, you can stack them perfectly. Flexbox cannot do this.

---

### 5. Alignment Mechanics
Flexbox and Grid share the "Box Alignment" specification, but they apply it differently:
- **`justify-content`**: Moves items along the **Main Axis** (Flex) or **Inline Axis** (Grid).
- **`align-items`**: Moves items along the **Cross Axis** (Flex) or **Block Axis** (Grid).
- **`place-items`**: A shorthand only for Grid (`align-items` + `justify-items`).

### 6. SDE 2 Decision Matrix

| Scenario | Recommendation | Why? |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Navbar / Toolbar** | **Flexbox** | 1D distribution, content-driven width. |
| **Card List (Auto-fit)** | **Grid** | `grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, ...)` creates a perfect grid without media queries. |
| **Complex Page Layout** | **Grid** | 2D control, `grid-template-areas` is easier to maintain. |
| **Centering a single item** | **Flexbox** | `display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center;` is the industry standard. |
| **Overlapping UI Elements** | **Grid** | Allows stacking items in the same cell. |

### Summary
*   **Flexbox** is for **distributing space** among a group of items (1D). It is **Content-driven**.
*   **Grid** is for **defining a structure** and placing items into it (2D). It is **Container-driven**.
*   Use Flexbox for small components and linear layouts; use Grid for page-level architecture and strict alignments.
